        <h1>NYC Parks Investigation</h1>
        
        <h2>What I'm Studying</h2>
        <p>
            I'm looking at parks in New York City to find out:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Which borough has the most parks?</li>
            <li>How many acres of parks are in each borough?</li>
            <li>Which areas have the most green space?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Parks are important because they:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Give people places to play and exercise</li>
            <li>Help keep our air clean</li>
            <li>Make our neighborhoods nicer places to live</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Prototypes:</h2>
        <img src="/images/prototype1.jpg"  style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-right: 150px; transform: rotate(-90deg); ">
        <img src="/images/prototype2.jpg"  style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 0px; transform: rotate(-90deg); ">

        <h3>Feedback and Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Turning numbers into a story:</b> I drew the 5 boroughs and created a simple legend. This made it easy for anyone to see the differences between areas in just a few seconds, instead of looking at a bunch of numbers.</li>
          <li><b>Simplicity and matching the chart to the message:</b> I kept the map and legend simple, so it was easy to read and not confusing. The chart matched my main question by showing the boroughs and using color to show the data.</li>
          <li><b>Helping the audience focus:</b> I made sure there weren't too many details, so people could focus on the main message right away.</li>
          <li><b>What changed in my final design and why:</b> In my final project, I changed my data from air quality to park acreage. On my borough pages I got feedback that using bar charts might be better to help visualize my data and see the differences between ZIP codes. I also got feedback to use the whitespace more effectivley, which I did by moving my text around.</li>
        </ul>
